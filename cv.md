## About me
Beginner Junior Front-End developer. I have been trained in HTML layout, CSS has a certificate, I am finishing training in JavaScript, then I plan to study React, React Native, Node, etc. Sociable, I quickly find a common language, not conflictual. 

I have a good attitude to constructive criticism and am ready to correct my mistakes. If you need a person who is ready to work, study and complete tasks on time, then I will be glad of your response.
